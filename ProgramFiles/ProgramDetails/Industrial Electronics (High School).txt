lab
exercises,
and
through
related
projects
including
the
construction
of
a
power

soldering.
Work
Practicum
The
Industrial

program
may
feature
a
Work

placement
in
a
local
workplace,
which
provides
students
with
on-the-job
training
and
experience.

in
such
situations,
the
Institute
will
explore
alternative
options
for
program
completion
with
a
student.We
also
provide
valuable
hands-on
experiences
in
this
program,
including
the
con-struction
of
a

With
the
expected
demand
for
workers
in
this
field,
this
program
will
